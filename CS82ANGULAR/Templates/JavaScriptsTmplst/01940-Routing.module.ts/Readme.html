    <h4>
        <strong>
            <u>Remark</u>
        </strong>
    </h4>
    Generators are divided into two groups.
    <ul>
        <li>The first group has a <strong>Context level</strong>.</li>
        <li>The second one is a <strong>View-Model level</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Context level</strong> code is generated once and shared by other parts of the application.<br>
        The <strong>View-Model level</strong> code must be regenerated for each view you select.
        That is, each view you select must have its own copy of the generated code.
        The <strong>View-Model level</strong> code generated for one view cannot be used by another view.
        For example, the product attributes input form is <strong>View-Model level</strong> code<br>
    </p>
    Each generator has a title which starts with 5 digits. <br>
    If the first two digits are zeros it is <strong>Context level</strong> generator for Wizards <br>
    If one the first two digits is non zero it is <strong>View-Model level</strong> generator for Wizards <p />


    The currently selected generator is a <strong>View-Model level</strong> code generator.<p />

    <strong>CLI-related information</strong><br>
    Suppose your view has a name <strong>ThisIsMyView</strong><br>
    <em>Inside your Angular project</em><br>
    <em>1. Run the command</em><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
            ng g module ThisIsMyView --routing
        </code>
    </pre>
    <em>2. It will create the folder <b>this-is-my-view</b> and inside create the set of files <b>this-is-my-view.module.ts</b> and <b>this-is-my-view-routing.module.ts</b> </em><br>
    <em>3. In Visual Studio right-click created fordel and generate the component-body</em> It updates <b>this-is-my-view-routing.module.ts</b> only.<br>
    <p />
    <strong>Project-related information</strong><br>
    <kbd>Step 0: Do not run the command described under <b>CLI-related information</b>. It's for information purpose only and makes you hint about the type of component you are going to generate</kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 1: Inside folder <b>src/app</b> create the folder <b>'components'</b> (You can choose any folder name you like: 'mycomponents' or 'mycode' and so on) </kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 2: Inside folder of step 1 (recommended <b>'components'</b>) create the folder <b>'this-is-my-view'</b> (You can choose any folder name you like: 'myviewfolder' or 'fooooo' and so on) </kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 4: In Visual Studio right-click the <strong>'this-is-my-view'</strong>-folder that you created in step 2 and generate the following items</kbd><br>
    <ul>
        <li>01940-Routing.module.ts</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Don't forget to click save-button.</strong> It saves the code into the file and adds some information into repository of the Wizards.
    Repository information is actively used by all other generators that you will run later.
    <p />
    The generated code is a routing paths that '01920-Rlist.component.ts' and '01820-Redit.component.ts' expect to obtain from the 'route.snapshot'.
    Please read explanation under '01920-Rlist.component.ts' or under '01820-Redit.component.ts' generators.<br>
    Note: '01940-Routing.module.ts' takes selected View-Model and generated path for all direct and indirect details.<br>
    But what about masters for the selected View-Model.<br>
    Suppose, selected View-Model has a master and you want to define navigation to the master.
    In this case you should apply '01940-Routing.module.ts'-generator for that master View-Model.
    It will generate all the paths not only for that master but for the selected View-Model as well.
    The next step is to remove the path that you are not going to use.

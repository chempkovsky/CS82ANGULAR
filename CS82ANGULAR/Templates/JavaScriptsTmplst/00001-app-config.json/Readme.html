    <h3>Reminder</h3>
    Generators are divided into two groups.
    <ul>
        <li>The first group has a <strong>Context level</strong>.</li>
        <li>The second one is a <strong>View-Model level</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Context level</strong> code is generated once and shared by other parts of the application.<br>
        The <strong>View-Model level</strong> code must be regenerated for each view you select.
        That is, each view you select must have its own copy of the generated code.
        The <strong>View-Model level</strong> code generated for one view cannot be used by another view.
        For example, the product attributes input form is <strong>View-Model level</strong> code<br>
    </p>
    Each generator has a title which starts with 5 digits. <br>
    If the first two digits are zeros it is <strong>Context level</strong> generator for Wizards <br>
    If one of the first two digits is non zero it is <strong>View-Model level</strong> generator for Wizards <p />


    The currently selected generator is a <strong>Context level</strong> code generator.<p />

    <h3>Will be used by</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>00014-app-config.service.ts</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

                Open generated file and go to 'addone(...)'-method<br>
                Verify that fields with automatically generated values are correctly defined.<br>
                An example of automatically generated values is Identity.<br>
                Here is a sample. Suppose 'publisherId' is a field with an automatically generated value.<br>
                <pre>
                <code>
    if(!(typeof item === 'undefined')) {
        if(!(item === null)) {
            if(typeof item.publisherId === 'undefined') {
                item['publisherId'] = 0;
            }
            if(item.publisherId === null) {
                    item['publisherId'] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                All is well if the type of 'publisherId' is an integer.<br>
                But if the type is String or Guid, you must define the assignment with the correct value.<br><br>
                You can delete the second 'if' statement if you are sure <br>
                that the 'Add New Item'-form does not define the current field by any value<br>
                Here is the second 'if' statement
                <pre>
                <code>
            if(item.publisherId === null) {
                    item['publisherId'] = 0;
            }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </td>

    <h4>
        <strong>
            <u>Remark</u>
        </strong>
    </h4>
    Generators are divided into two groups.
    <ul>
        <li>The first group has a <strong>Context level</strong>.</li>
        <li>The second one is a <strong>View-Model level</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Context level</strong> code is generated once and shared by other parts of the application.<br>
        The <strong>View-Model level</strong> code must be regenerated for each view you select.
        That is, each view you select must have its own copy of the generated code.
        The <strong>View-Model level</strong> code generated for one view cannot be used by another view.
        For example, the product attributes input form is <strong>View-Model level</strong> code<br>
    </p>
    Each generator has a title which starts with 5 digits. <br>
    If the first two digits are zeros it is <strong>Context level</strong> generator for Wizards <br>
    If one the first two digits is non zero it is <strong>View-Model level</strong> generator for Wizards <p />


    The currently selected generator is a <strong>View-Model level</strong> code generator.<p />

    <strong>CLI-related information</strong><br>
    Suppose your view has a name <strong>ThisIsMyView</strong><br>
    <em>Inside your Angular project</em><br>
    <em>1. Run the command</em><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
            ng g service <b>ThisIsMyView</b> 
    </code>
    </pre>
    <kbd>It will create a file <b>this-is-my-view.service.ts</b></kbd><br>
    <em>2. In Visual Studio right-click the folder with a file and generate the service-body</em><br>
    <p />
    <strong>Project-related information</strong><br>
    <kbd>Step 0: Do not run the command described under <b>CLI-related information</b>. It's for information purpose only and makes you hint about the type of component you are going to generate</kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 1: Inside folder <b>src/app</b> create the folder <b>'services'</b> (You can choose any folder name you like: 'myservices' or 'mysrvscode' and so on) </kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 2: Inside folder of step 1 (recommended <b>'services'</b>) create the folder <b>'this-is-my-view'</b> (You can choose any folder name you like: 'myviewfolder' or 'fooooo' and so on) </kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 3: In Visual Studio right-click the <strong>'this-is-my-view'</strong>-folder that you created in step 2 and generate the following items</kbd><br>
    <ul>
        <li>01400-.service.ts</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Don't forget to click save-button.</strong> It saves the code into the file and adds some information into repository of the Wizards.
    Repository information is actively used by all other generators that you will run later.
    <p />
    01400-.service.ts is a service that implements webApi-calls for the given view.<br>
    01400-.service.ts uses '@angular/common/http'<p />
    01400-.service.ts is a service that is used by the 'View-Model level' components for the given view.<br>

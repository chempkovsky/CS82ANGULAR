            <u>Remark</u>
        </strong>
    </h4>
    Generators are divided into three groups.
    <ul>
        <li>The first group has a <strong>Context level</strong>.</li>
        <li>The second one is a <strong>View-Model level</strong>. </li>
        <li>The third one is a <strong>Feature level</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Context level</strong> code is generated once and shared by other parts of the application.<br>
        The <strong>View-Model level</strong> code must be regenerated for each view you select.
        That is, each view you select must have its own copy of the generated code.<br>
        The <strong>View-Model level</strong> code generated for one view cannot be used by another view.<br>
        For example, the product attributes input form is <strong>View-Model level</strong> code<br>
        <strong>Feature level</strong> code must be regenerated for each feature you select.<br>
    </p>
    Each generator has a title which starts with 5 digits. <br>
    If the first two digits are zeros it is <strong>Context level</strong> generator for Wizards <br>
    If one the first two digits is non zero it is <strong>View-Model level</strong> generator for Wizards
    If one the first two digits is non zero it is <strong>Feature level</strong> generator for Wizards
    <p />


    The currently selected generator is a <strong>Feature level</strong> code generator.<p />

    <strong>CLI-related information</strong><br>
    Suppose your view has a name <strong>ThisIsMyFeature</strong><br>
    <em>Inside your Angular project</em><br>
    <em>1. Run the command</em><br>
    <pre>
    <code>
            ng g component ThisIsMyFeatureFtr
        </code>
    </pre>
    <kbd>It will create a file <b>this-is-my-feature-ftr.component.*</b></kbd><br>
    <em>2. In Visual Studio right-click the folder with a file and generate the component-body</em><br>
    <p />
    <strong>Project-related information</strong><br>
    <kbd>Step 0: Do not run the command described under <b>CLI-related information</b>. It's for information purpose only and makes you hint about the type of component you are going to generate</kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 1: Inside folder <b>src/app</b> create the folder <b>'features'</b> (You can choose any folder name you like: 'myfeatures' or 'mycode' and so on) </kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 2: Inside folder of step 1 (recommended <b>'features'</b>) create the folder <b>'this-is-my-feature'</b> (You can choose any folder name you like: 'myviewfolder' or 'fooooo' and so on) </kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 3: Inside folder of step 2 (recommended <b>'this-is-my-feature'</b>) create the folder <b>'ftr'</b> (You can choose any folder name you like: 'myfolder' or 'fooooo' and so on) </kbd><br>
    <kbd>Step 4: In Visual Studio right-click the <strong>'ftr'</strong>-folder that you created in step 3 and generate the following items</kbd><br>
    <ul>
        <li>30100-Ftr.component.css</li>
        <li>30100-Ftr.component.html</li>
        <li>30100-Ftr.component.ts</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Don't forget to click save-button.</strong> It saves the code into the file and adds some information into repository of the Wizards.
    Repository information is actively used by all other generators that you will run later.
    <p />30100-Ftr.component(.css/.html).ts<br />
    This component is a Dashboard for the selected View-Models. It dispalys following forms each in the separate window:

        <li>01920-Rlist</li>
        <li>02020-Rdlist</li>
        <li>02210-Checkedrole</li>
